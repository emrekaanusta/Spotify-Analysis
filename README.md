ðŸ§™ CS 210 - Introduction to Data Science Project ðŸ§™

This project is made for "Introduction to Data Science" - CS 210 class. After not believing my Spotify Wrapped every year, I decided to take the ropes in my hands and find my top artists, songs and albums year by year and all time! You can interact with the website through your localhost. All you need to do is to download or clone the repository, and run "app.py". I encourage you to do the same and find your "real" top Spotify stats using your own Spotilyzer!!!
