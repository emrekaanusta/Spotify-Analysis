# Spotify-Analysis
ðŸ§™ CS 210 - Introduction to Data Science Project ðŸ§™

This project is made for "Introduction to Data Science" - CS 210 class. After not believing my Spotify Wrapped every year, I decided to take the ropes in my hands and find my top artists, songs and albums year by year and all time! As you may know spotify has a timeline -which they do not share with us- starting from god knows when and ends around november. Since I wanted to have a more definite statistics, I looked through the data of mine. And the results were surprising since my "Spotify Wrapped" was somewhat different than the actual results. I encourage you to do the same and find your "real" top Spotify stats using your own Spotilyzer!!!


You can see my website on your localhost following these steps:

1- Clone the repository to your own device. You can do this by typing "git clone https://github.com/emrekaanusta/Spotilyzer" to your terminal.

2- Then change your directory to the current cloned directory. You can do this by using -cd- commands or through searching your computer. I suggest using VS Code in this step.

3- Then all you need to do is running "app.py" file. You can do this by simply typing "python app.py" to your console! But if these 3 steps seems loooooong to you, here is a video preview of my site.
